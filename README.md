# GWU Bootcamp Project #1

Project by: Sania Ahmad, Haris Nawzadi, Sobaid Zewari

Project Outline: For our first project, we investigated to see whether fildwires are on the rise, as a result of climate change. We looked at a large dataset on wildfire outbreaks across the United States since 1992. We looked at a number of different factors by state, including # of occurances, size of fire, and frequency of fires for all states over time. 

Importing, Cleaning, and Graphing: 
The first step was to import the data as a data frame. There were 7 large csv files that needed to be concatenated. After extensive cleaning of the data frame, we then each used this data frame to analyze specfic factors and graphed them using Matplotlib.
